"Pointless to bring up an issue with Spectrum, whether on the phone, socials, or the app, the results are the same...Nothing. I'd highly recommend using someone else. Either, Wi-Fi streaming on the TV is buffering several times on the daily or my phone has been disconnected, while at home. I pay for the utmost premium package yet I still have these problems, so it doesn't matter what package you pay for the service is bad, bad, bad. As well as, the app not working even after the latest updates!"
My thing is they changed the old format as far as your phone being remote. Now you can't switch back and forth between shows you were watching. And you used to be able to long press on the movie and it would show what movie was about. Thats gone now too. It was so perfect the old way. It is so much worse now. If it was the old format i would give Spectrum 5 stars. Please take my comments and please consider that other people more than likely are having the same problems
"The app will not let me check on my router or modem like it used to... I cannot choose that option, it's there but when I tap on it it literally does nothing... I can't check my connection. And also, internet speeds have been terrible. I've had spectrum for about 3 years now and never really had a problem until now, speed is rough... And they continue to increase prices without telling me and without improving any speed or anything. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Thinking about switching service providers due to this."
